# Tracking Demo

This demo contains 2 third party APIs (Google and PubNub). Google MAPS API is used to show the Map and the pointer of the location if allowed otherwise show static Location of San Francisco. Whereas, PubNub API is used to animate the pointer from the current location to on wards by adding the `0.001` in Latitude and `0.01` in Longitude.

It is just static Demo. You need to get your Google Map and PubNub API Keys and put it in the `Dialog Box`to make this demo working.
